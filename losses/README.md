## Introduction

The "losses" folder houses implementations of various loss functions that quantify the difference between predicted values and actual target values during neural network training. These loss functions play a critical role in guiding the optimization process to minimize errors and improve model performance.

## Files

### `CrossEntropy.py`

A Python module that defines the Cross-Entropy loss function. Cross-Entropy loss is commonly used for classification tasks, particularly when dealing with multiple classes. It measures the dissimilarity between predicted probabilities and true class labels.

### `MSE.py`

A Python module containing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function. MSE is often used for regression tasks and calculates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

### `__init__.py`

An initialization file that designates the "losses" folder as a Python package, allowing the included modules to be imported and utilized within other parts of the project.

## Contributing

Contributions to the "losses" folder are welcome! If you have additional loss functions to add or improvements to suggest, feel free to open a pull request.

## License

The modules within the "losses" folder inherit the same [MIT License](../LICENSE) as the main repository.
