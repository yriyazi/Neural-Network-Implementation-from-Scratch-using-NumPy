## Introduction

The "model" folder serves as a storage location for saved neural network model weights. These weights are saved in CSV format and represent the learned parameters of the neural network after training.

## Files

This folder contains one or more CSV files, each corresponding to the weights of a trained neural network model. The filenames may include information about the network architecture, training settings, and other relevant details.

For example:
- `layer_0_biases.csv`
- `layer_0_weights.csv`

You can use these saved weights to load pre-trained models, perform inference on new data, or continue training from a certain checkpoint.

## Contributing

As the "model" folder primarily serves as a storage location for model weights, contributions related to model weights files are not expected. However, if you have suggestions or improvements related to the overall project structure or usage of saved weights, feel free to share your ideas.

## License

The saved neural network model weights within the "model" folder are part of the overall project and inherit the same [MIT License](../LICENSE) as the main repository.
