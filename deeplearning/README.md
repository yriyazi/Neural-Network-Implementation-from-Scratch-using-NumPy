## Introduction

The "deeplearning" folder encompasses essential components of deep learning, including the structure of neural networks, training and testing loops, and related processes. These modules are crucial for building, training, and evaluating neural networks on various tasks.

## Files

### `__init__.py`

An initialization file that designates the "deeplearning" folder as a Python package, enabling modules within the folder to be imported and used across the project.

### `Structure.py`

A Python module that defines the structure and architecture of a neural network. This module includes functions for setting up layers, conducting forward and backward passes, and handling training and testing processes.

### `test_loop.py`

A Python module that implements the testing loop for evaluating a trained neural network. This module contains functions to calculate accuracy and other metrics on a test dataset.

### `train_loop.py`

A Python module that implements the training loop for a neural network. This module includes functions for iterating through epochs, performing forward and backward passes, and updating network parameters using optimization techniques.

## Contributing

Contributions to the "deeplearning" folder are welcome! Whether you want to enhance training algorithms, optimize testing procedures, or improve network architecture, feel free to open a pull request.

## License

The modules within the "deeplearning" folder inherit the same [MIT License] as the main repository.
