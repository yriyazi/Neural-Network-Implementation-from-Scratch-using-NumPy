## Introduction

The "utils" folder within this repository contains utility functions that are helpful for different tasks related to the neural network implementation. These functions provide support for common operations, such as evaluating model performance, data preprocessing, and more.

## Functions

  ### `compute_confusion_matrix(true, pred)`
    
    Computes a confusion matrix using NumPy for two numpy arrays: `true` and `pred`.
    
    Args:
    - `true` (numpy.ndarray): Array of true labels.
    - `pred` (numpy.ndarray): Array of predicted labels.
    
    Returns:
    - numpy.ndarray: The confusion matrix where rows represent true classes and columns represent predicted classes.
    
    This function calculates a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It counts the occurrences of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions for each class. The result is a matrix that provides insights into the model's classification accuracy and misclassifications across different classes. This implementation is independent of the scikit-learn library, providing an alternative way to compute confusion matrices.
