## Introduction

The "nets" folder is dedicated to various aspects of neural network implementation, including activation functions, layer structures, and optimization techniques. These components play a crucial role in defining and training neural networks for different tasks.

## Files

### `ActivationFunction_test.ipynb`

An interactive Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage and properties of different activation functions. This notebook provides insights into the behavior and impact of various activation functions on neural network training.

### `Activation_functions.py`

A Python module that defines different activation functions commonly used in neural networks. This module includes functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh, which introduce non-linearity into the network's computation.

### `Layers.py`

A Python module containing the implementation of neural network layers, such as the dense (fully connected) layer. This module defines classes that represent different layer types and include methods for forward and backward passes.

### `__init__.py`

An initialization file that marks the "nets" folder as a Python package, allowing the contained modules to be imported and used within other parts of the project.

### `optimizer.py`

A Python module that provides different optimization techniques for training neural networks. This module includes classes like SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) that enable efficient weight updates during the training process.

## Contributing

Contributions to the "nets" folder, including adding new activation functions, optimizing layers, or enhancing optimizers, are welcome! If you have improvements to suggest or want to add new components, feel free to open a pull request.
